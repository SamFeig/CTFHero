description: Our spies managed to send an email with false orders to the two big generals of the Dark Lord(tm)'s army instructing them to pull the self-destruct lever. However, we can only send one email before our spy is vaporized, but the generals need to receive a very specific set of files to pull the lever. I have sent you those sets and I want you to give me a base64 encoded zip file that, upon extraction by each general, will output exactly the files on their set.
