I would like to thank:
- Arduboy developers for building the Arduboy and providing the SDK and useful
  documentation and examples.
- The Arduboy community for useful tips on developing games.
- Team A.R.G. (http://team-arg.org) for their high quality work on games and
  demos. I am really impressed by what they showed it's possible to achieve with
  the Arduboy. Also, reading the source code of their games was really
  instructive.
