# name: GDB as a service
description: It's GDB but in the Browser. Finally web developers can help debug the backends! Unfortunately, the premium version is not public yet. But you can try out the trial version for now (checkout the pwn category). If you want a product demo, we have it running at the organizers table.
We also like cat videos ;). If you'd like to share some with us, load it in on this page: https://sirdarckcat.github.io/ctf/mirror.html#$use_some_random_string_here and tell us the URL.
