# description: My lovely painting got destroyed and I would like to ask for your help with recovering it. That was a breathtaking painting of a Turing machine execution trace. I remember exactly how the very bottom of the painting looked like. It's in the painting.tga file. I also remember, but only partially, how the painting looked locally - everything I recall is in colorings.tga. I've found the implementation of the machine on a floppy disk, but it got destroyed a bit. All I have is in machine.h. verifier.out could help you a bit too, at least to get started.
