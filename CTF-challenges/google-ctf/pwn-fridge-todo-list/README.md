# name:Fridge TODO list
description: One of the main selling points of smart fridge 2000 over the smart fridge 1999 is that it comes with a TODO list network service. We heard that Wintermuted uses this list as a password storage, maybe you can find a bug to leak their notes? Luckily we found the source code of the TODO list on the vendor's website.
