Contestants will upload an html file to the website in order to retrieve the flag from another section of the website.
The screenshot section of the website tries to fill in a textbox on the webpage if it has the correct name.


## Solution ##

Upload a file that redirects console.log to be displayed on the webpage.
Having a screenshot taken of this webpage will show that reveal that it is missing a field called 'da flag field'.
Adding this field (such as in solution.html) and once more getting a screenshot will reveal the flag (MCA{8Fo4Mcg1vp}).
