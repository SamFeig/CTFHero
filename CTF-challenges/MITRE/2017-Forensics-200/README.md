# File Reconstruction

This exercise is comprised of a .zip file containing 20 fragmented files that must be reconstructed to form the original file.  Upon examination of the split files, the participant will identify that 8 of the 20 files are duplicate and can be discarded.  Four of the remaining files will contain two different PNG header files, one JPG footer, and one without a footer.  The participant will need to determine which is the correct header and convert it back to a JPG as well as use the file containing the footer while discarding the other two files.  The participant can then concatenate the files together which will allow the participant the ability to open the file and retrieve the challenge flag value.
