Implementation:

I used GIMP to draw up this sentence and the following links to determine how to create it:

Solution:

The 'message' seems to be made up of a bunch of circles. Googling "circle language" in image search brings up some similar-looking pictures which should allow you to find that the language is called gallifreyan. There is also the word 'gallifreyan' hidden in the image's data if you look at it as text in notepad, or googling "circle language the doctor" will bring you to a guide on writing in gallifreyan.

You should be able to determine that the large circle is a sentence, the slightly smaller circles words, and the smallest circles letters. The order of each is read counter-clockwise starting from the bottom.

As seen in the guide images (PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE THIS IN THE CHALLENGE WEBPAGE), the full sentence spells out "The flag sounds like Emsee a bead kafe." As stated in the guides to Gallifreyan, there is no letter for 'c' and so instead it is replaced by 'k' or 's' depending on the sound in context. So, the full flag would be MCA-BEADCAFE.
