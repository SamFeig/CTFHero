<p>We paid someone to improve our Slim Shady fan club website, endorsed by Shady himself. I guess he didn't like Slim Shady though, because he hacked into our emails and made our website worse. We would like you to fix it.</p>
<p>Slim Shady should have sent me an email with the password to go and reset the site, but there are so many in my email, I don't know which to use! Here are all the <a href="emails.xml">emails</a> I have theoretically gotten from Slim.</p>
<p>Oh, and it probably won't be much use, but here's what's left of our <a href="slimshadyfanclub.html">website</a>, in case it helps you design the new website.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>
