# Re Danker

In this challenge competitors are expected to read through the source code for re-danker.asm and figure out that the program is using a modified fibbonacci which is calculated based on `fibonacci(n - 1) + (fibonacci(n - 2) % 13371337)`, instead of regular fibbonacci. Once they figure this out they can then write the solver in another language (our solver is in python) where they can optimize the calculation.
