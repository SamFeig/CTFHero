 # Clipboard Trust Issues

## How to Solve

1. Open source to html page
1. copy the key from in there

the html page has javascript that will change the key on your clipboard from MCA{C0PYING_1z_d@ng3r0us} to MCA{C0PYING_lz_d@ng3r0us} where the '1' changes to a 'l'. 

...don't trust your clipboard.......ever
