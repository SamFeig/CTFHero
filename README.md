Project for HackCU V by Sam Feig, Jay Hayward, and Mark Wilmes

We wanted to make a tool to help people learn about Cybersecurity Capture the Flag challenges and how to go about solving a few basic and fun ones! We also wanted to set up a way to host CTF competitions through the CU Cybersecurity Club and get more people involved in this amazing field. CTFHero creates a platform with a huge potential to help people who are just starting, as well as veterans, learn and grow their skills in cybersecurity.
